Cultural Impact and Societal Relevance** \n_The Simpsons_ debuted as a subversive critique of American middle-class life, gaining notoriety for its bold satire in the 1990s. Initially a countercultural phenomenon, it challenged norms with episodes tackling religion, politics, and consumerism. Over time, its cultural dominance waned as competitors like _South Park_ and _Family Guy_ pushed boundaries further. By the 2010s, the show transitioned from trendsetter to nostalgic institution, balancing legacy appeal with attempts to address modern issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, albeit with less societal resonance.\n**2. Character Development and Storytelling Shifts** \nEarly seasons featured nuanced character arcs (e.g., Lisa’s activism, Marge’s resilience), but later seasons saw \"Flanderization\" (exaggerating traits, e.g., Homer’s stupidity, Ned Flanders’ piety). Humor evolved from witty, character-driven satire to reliance on pop culture references and meta-humor. Serialized storytelling in early episodes gave way to episodic, gag-focused plots, often sacrificing emotional depth for absurdity.\n[...]\n**12. Merchandising and Global Reach** \nThe 1990s merchandise boom (action figures, _Simpsons_-themed cereals) faded, but the franchise persists via collaborations (e.g., _Fortnite_ skins, Lego sets). International adaptations include localized dubbing and culturally tailored episodes (e.g., Japanese _Itchy & Scratchy_ variants).\n**Conclusion** \n_The Simpsons_ evolved from a radical satire to a television institution, navigating shifts in technology, politics, and audience expectations. While its golden-age brilliance remains unmatched, its adaptability—through streaming, updated humor, and global outreach—secures its place as a cultural touchstone. The show’s longevity reflects both nostalgia and a pragmatic embrace of change, even as it grapples with the challenges of relevance in a fragmented media landscape.\n","[\"Who is the director of God'S Gift To Women?\", 'Who is the director of Aldri annet enn bråk?', 'What are the ages of the respective directors?', 'Which director is older?']\n","The director of \"God's Gift To Women\" is Michael Curtiz, the director of \"Aldri annet enn bråk\" is Edith Carlmar\n","[\"Find the birthdate of Michael Curtiz, the director of God's Gift To Women\", 'Find the birthdate of Edith Carlmar, the director of Aldri annet enn bråk']\n","The director of \"God's Gift To Women\" is Michael Curtiz, who was born on December 24, 1886 and passed away on April 11, 1962.
